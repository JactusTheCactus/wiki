<p>Veronica is a very dominant person but is fiercely protective of those close to her. her father was KGB and gave her
    extensive CQC training. Veronica's father was abusive. it is hard to earn Veronica's trust, but when you do, she
    will protect you with her life. Veronica has very good control over her temper, but when the dam breaks, the flood
    is devastating. she hits like a truck.</p>
<p>Veronica can shapeshift into a large grizzly bear on command, hence her nickname "Медведь", the Russian word for
    "Bear"</p>
