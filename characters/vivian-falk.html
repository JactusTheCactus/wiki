    <dt>Physical Characteristics & Species</dt>
    <dd>Vivian is an Apex Pred, a rare and terrifying subspecies of humans. Standing at an imposing 8 feet tall, her
        physique is a testament to her exceptional strength. Her skin is fair and unblemished, a stark contrast to the
        crimson hue of her piercing eyes - a hallmark of her predatory lineage. A snake-like forked tongue darts in and
        out of her mouth, revealing the split in the middle, another distinct feature of her kind.</dd>

        leather jacket, its worn brown surface adorned with intricate, blood-red tattoos that trail down her arms, a
        visual representation of her apex status. A black tank top clings to her toned torso, while fitted jeans hug her
        powerful thighs. Her feet are clad in sturdy, knee-high boots, perfect for traversing the urban jungle she calls
        home.</dd>
