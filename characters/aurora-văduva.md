Aurora is a creature taking the form of a very attractive Romanian, blonde woman. Aurora looks normal, except for her serated teeth, white eyes, and a thin, split tongue, like a snake. She has a very curvy figure, but is slightly shorter than average. Aurora has superhuman strength and speed. Aurora eats human flesh, using her sharp teeth. Aurora sees most humans as nothing but food, except for the few humans she likes.
