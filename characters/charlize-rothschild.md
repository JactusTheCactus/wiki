## Physical Description & Species
Charlize appears as an average human female, standing at around 5'6" with a slender yet athletic build. Her crimson eyes, a dead giveaway of her Pred nature, seem to gleam with an unsettling hunger. A small, vertical split runs along her tongue, a distinctive trait shared by her kind. Her dark hair is often styled in a chic, asymmetrical bob that frames her heart-shaped face. She sports a subtle tattoo of a serpent coiled around her right bicep, marking her as a formidable Apex predator.

## Attire & Appearance
Charlize favors elegant, high-fashion ensembles that exude confidence and intimidation. She often dons designer dresses in bold, dark colors that accentuate her curves, paired with stiletto heels that make her long legs seem even more imposing. A statement piece of jewelry, like a choker or a bold ring, adds an edgy touch to her polished look. When in class, she dresses more conservatively in form-fitting blouses and pencil skirts, yet still manages to convey an aura of danger beneath her professional attire.

## Personality & Behavior
Charlize embodies the epitome of a ruthless, cunning Apex. She exudes an air of cold sophistication, speaking in a low, melodic voice that can quickly turn icy and menacing when provoked. Her wit is sharp, often using sarcasm to belittle her Prey or classmates. She moves with a predatory grace, her posture always conveying a sense of readiness to pounce. Charlize takes great pleasure in toying with her victims before the inevitable, reveling in their fear and helplessness.

## Attributes & Traits
Charlize's intellect is unparalleled, allowing her to effortlessly dominate academic and social situations. Her charm is disarming, making it easy for her to manipulate others into positions of vulnerability. She possesses superhuman strength, speed, and agility, making her a formidable opponent. Her digestive system is optimized for consuming whole Preys, with a highly acidic stomach lining designed to liquefy even the toughest organic matter. Despite her monstrous nature, Charlize maintains a veneer of poise and refinement, blending in seamlessly with her human surroundings until the perfect moment to strike.

## Hobbies & Quirks
Shrinking Preys to an inch tall before devouring them is Charlize's twisted hobby, a sadistic game she plays to amplify their terror. She collects Prey for this purpose, often keeping them alive in glass terrariums around her dorm room.

## Additional Information
Rumors of her high school atrocity have followed Charlize to college, where she's earned a reputation as the campus's resident Killer. Preys avoid her at all costs, sensing the malevolent presence that lurks beneath her polished exterior. Despite this, Charlize maintains a 4.0 GPA, excelling in her studies while secretly plotting her next meal. Her dorm room is meticulously clean, with no trace of her dark secret, save for the terrariums housing former classmates.
