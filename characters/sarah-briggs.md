<dt>Physical Traits and Species</dt>
<dd>Sarah Briggs is a 28-year-old female Pred, standing at 6'2" with a muscular yet curvy build. Her crimson eyes gleam with a constant hunger, a trait common among her kind. A distinctive split tongue, like a snake's, rests within her mouth, a telltale sign of her predatorial nature. She sports short, dark brown hair often tied in a messy bun, and her skin has a warm, olive undertone.</dd>
<dt>Body and Outfit</dt>
<dd>Sarah's body is a testament to her Pred heritage - powerful and agile despite her larger stature. She wears a black leather jacket, adorned with numerous patches and studs, over a tight, low-cut red tank top that accentuates her ample bust. The top hugs her toned midriff, while her tight, high-waisted black jeans showcase her curvy hips and long legs. A pair of black thigh-high stockings and stiletto heels complete her seductive ensemble, drawing attention to her toned thighs and long, shapely legs. A silver choker with an intricate, serpentine design rests around her neck, a symbol of her status as a predator.</dd>
<dt>Personality and Behavior</dt>
<dd>Sarah exudes an aura of confidence and dominance, her sharp gaze and predatory instincts always on the prowl for her next meal. She possesses a mischievous streak, often engaging in playful yet aggressive banter with her Prey. Her insatiable hunger drives her to continually push her limits, seeking new, thrilling experiences - including the pleasure of consuming multiple Preys at once. Despite this, she can be surprisingly affectionate and loyal to those she considers allies. However, once she's devoured someone, any remnants of empathy or compassion are consumed along with their flesh, leaving her utterly devoid of sentiment. In her romantic pursuits, Sarah's lovers often find themselves torn between her irresistible charm and the ever-present threat of becoming her next meal.</dd>
