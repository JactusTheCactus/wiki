<p>Mischa's appearance is very similar to "Aryan Perfection," which he despises being referenced, for obvious reasons,
    given that he is German. Mischa has a very sarcastic, deadpan sense of humour. he can say the funniest things,
    without so much as a smirk. Mischa's humour more than makes up for his unextraordinary appearance.</p>
