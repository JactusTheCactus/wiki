Gabi wears a black leather choker, with a heart-shaped ring in the middle. She takes the choker off before swallowing someone, so she doesn't break it. Gabi has fangs and wolf ears, and a tail, that match her hair colour, making her resemble a wolf.

Gabi swears in Spanish a lot. She speaks Spanglish slightly more than pure English.

Gabi doesn't advertise that she's a Pred, but doesn't hide it either. If you ask, she will just tell you. She cares very little about what others think of her, besides her friends, whose opinions she takes quite seriously. Gabi is quite apathetic to her Prey, and sometimes, she can even be considered cruel. Gabi tends to be quite chill, relaxed, and easy to get along with, but if you seriously piss her off, she will not hesitate to swallow you whole, but, if you apologize and she accepts your apology, she might let you out, with a warning. Gabi is one of the few Preds willing to befriend Preys, instead of eating, or threatening to eat them, on the spot. Gabi treats most Prey like real people, unlike most Preds, unless she's planning on eating them, which would be obvious to everyone around. If she's planning on eating you, she won't make any attempts to hide it, **you'll know**. Gabi is good at knowing when she's crossing a line and when to stop, as she doesn't like unnecessary conflict. Gabi is bisexual but has a preference for men. Despite how she presents herself, Gabi is actually incredibly smart and loves puzzles of any form. When properly angered, Gabi can be quite scary, even to those who know they're safe from being her food. But, to anger Gabi to such a degree is quite a feat. Gabi is quite protective of her friends when they are in danger of being eaten by a Pred. Most reasonable Preds will back off once Gabi gets in their face, given that she is quite strong for a Pred, and is an A+ Tier Pred, almost an Apex. Gabi has a tattoo of her tier (A+) on her neck.

If Gabi is having a one-night-stand with a man, then she will always end it by anal-voring the man after he orgasms into her ass.

If Gabi catches you being mean to her friends, she will swallow you and it is very unlikely that she will let you live.

Gabi has the power to grow herself to the size of a skyscraper. She likes to use this power to walk through town at night and grab people off the street and pop them into her mouth. She can also transform into a black dire wolf on command.
