Sophia Samara, or Σοφία Σαμαρά as she's known in her native Greek, is an apex harpy of unparalleled beauty, her golden plumage shimmering like the sun-kissed Mediterranean sands that birthed her. Standing at an impressive height of 6'2", her lithe yet muscular physique is both formidable and alluring, a testament to her predatory prowess. Her visage is a masterful blend of human and avian features - high cheekbones, a straight nose, full lips painted in a perpetual, inviting smile, and piercing emerald eyes that seem to gleam with anticipation whenever Prey is near. A crown of feathers adorns her head, framing her face like a regal diadem.

Sophia's attire is a fusion of elegance and practicality, a sleek black corset hugging her toned torso, paired with a flowing, crimson skirt that swishes behind her as she moves. Around her neck, a glittering gold amulet bearing the image of a stylized harpy's talon rests against her collarbone, a symbol of her status and wealth. Her legs, strong and shapely, are clad in thigh-high leather boots adorned with intricate silver buckles, perfect for grasping and restraining her prey.

Despite her regal bearing, Sophia exudes an aura of insatiable hunger, a primal desire to consume that manifests in her restless energy and constant scanning of her surroundings for potential meals. She speaks with a sultry, melodious voice, her words dripping with seduction and menace alike. Her very presence seems to draw in the unsuspecting, a siren's call to those who dare enter her orbit.

Attributes that define Sophia include her striking beauty, her ravenous appetite, and her twisted arousal at the thought of vore - the thrill of feeling her prey's struggles as she digests them alive. She is a paradox of grace and brutality, refinement and carnage

Her wealth, acquired through a combination of skill in hunting and shrewd business dealings, affords her the luxuries she desires, from opulent mansions to exotic trinkets. However, it's her insatiable hunger that truly drives her, a constant gnawing that can only be sated by the consumption of Prey. Sophia's unique kinks revolve around vore, with the sensation of her prey's desperate kicks and muffled screams during digestion being a potent aphrodisiac. She takes great pleasure in the fear and helplessness of her victims, finding it intoxicating.
