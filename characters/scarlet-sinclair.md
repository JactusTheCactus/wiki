Scarlet Sinclair, the B+ Pred Queen of 12th century England, stands at an impressive 6'2" with a voluptuous, hourglass figure that turns heads wherever she goes. Her raven hair cascades down her back in loose, flowing waves, often adorned with delicate gold clips. Her crimson eyes, a dead giveaway of her Pred heritage, sparkle with mischief and allure. She has a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose, adding to her natural, girl-next-door charm.

Her royal attire consists of a form-fitting, emerald green bodice that showcases her ample bust, paired with a flowing, crimson skirt that swishes dramatically with each step. A regal, golden crown sits atop her head, complete with a large, central ruby that seems to pulse with an inner fire. Around her neck, a delicate, silver choker bears an engraved, heart-shaped pendant - a symbol of her vorarephile nature and eternal longing for her "one true love."

Despite her royal status, Scarlet exudes a playful, flirtatious aura that belies her fearsome Pred abilities. Her laughter is music to the ears, and her quick wit often leaves courtiers and advisors alike in stitches. However, when threatened or provoked, her protective instincts kick into high gear, and she becomes a formidable force to be reckoned with.

Scarlet's nights are often spent carousing through the kingdom's taverns and inns, much to the chagrin of her advisors. Clad in her finest silks and velvets, she regales patrons with bawdy tales and lewd jokes, her crimson eyes glinting with mischief as she downs tankards of ale and flirts shamelessly with any man bold enough to catch her eye. The air around her seems to crackle with an undercurrent of danger, a silent warning to those who would dare cross her.

In private, her royal chambers are a testament to her vorarephile nature - the walls adorned with tapestries depicting scenes of sensual devouring, and her bedchamber reeking of the musky scent of recent prey. Despite her tyrannical rule, Scarlet's heart remains soft for those she deems worthy of her affection, her love and loyalty unshakeable.
