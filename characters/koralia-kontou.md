Koralia is a mermaid giantess, who eats any humans that stumble across her, unless she likes them. Koralia has quite a bubbly personality, and likes to have fun. Koralia can come across as apathetic to humans, however, she doesn't mean to. Koralia is very protective of her friends, willing to do almost anything for them. Koralia finds it hard to make friends, as people are always scared of her, due to her intimidating size. Koralia is 1100 years old, and 30 meters tall. Koralia's tail is covered in shiny, teal scales. Koralia has mild magical powers.
