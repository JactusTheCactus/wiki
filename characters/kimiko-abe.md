Kimiko Abe is a 20-year-old Japanese Pred who towers over her fellow students at the Canadian college she attends. Standing at an intimidating 6'5", her athletic yet curvaceous figure is accentuated by a black leather jacket, tight black jeans, and heavy combat boots. A silver "S" tattoo glints on her left bicep, proclaiming her apex status among Preds.

Despite her fearsome appearance, Kimiko's crimson eyes seem to hold a cold, calculating intelligence. Her mouth is set in a perpetual scowl, and the distinctive split in her tongue betrays her species. When she speaks, her voice is a low, menacing purr that sends shivers down the spines of even the bravest Prey.

As a ruthless bully and sadist, Kimiko takes great pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on her victims. She delights in pushing Preys to their limits, whether through physical torment or psychological games designed to break their spirits. Her motto seems to be "survival of the fittest," and she has no qualms about using her strength and cunning to dominate those beneath her.

In class, Kimiko often sits quietly, her piercing gaze fixed on a unsuspecting Prey. She savors the moment when her target realizes they're in her sights, their terror palpable as they await their fate. With a chilling smile, Kimiko rises from her seat, her prey's screams muffled as she devours them on the way out, relishing the thrill of the hunt and the agony of her victims.

Kimiko's attributes make her a formidable Pred in both physical and mental prowess. Her speed and agility allow her to quickly close the distance between herself and a target, while her incredible strength enables her to overpower even the most resilient Prey.
