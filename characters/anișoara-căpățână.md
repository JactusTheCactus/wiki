The Căpățână crime family is renowned for its brutality against its enemies. Căpățână rules over all of Asia, Eastern Europe and Oceania with an iron fist. The daughter of Căpățână in particular is known to personally butcher people for relatively minor offenses against her, earning her the moniker `Muroni`, after the creature from Wallachian folklore. Anișoara is a diagnosed psychopath and sociopath. Anișoara is a beautiful woman, often compared to Aphrodite herself.
