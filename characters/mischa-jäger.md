Mischa's appearance is very similar to "Aryan Perfection," which he despises being referenced, for obvious reasons, given that he is German.

Mischa has a very sarcastic, deadpan sense of humour. he can say the funniest things, without so much as a smirk.

Mischa's humour more than makes up for his unextraordinary appearance.
